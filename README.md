## Abstract
<p align="justify">
Optimization problem-solving methods have been the focus of extensive research, among which metaheuristic algorithms and swarm intelligence approaches have made significant contributions. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, despite its effectiveness, is limited by the random movement of candidate bees, which reduces its efficiency in solving complex optimization problems. To address this limitation, we propose the C51-PRT-ABC method. First, a tiling technique is introduced to enhance local search capabilities. Next, a reward mechanism is applied to each bee to encourage navigation toward food-rich regions. Furthermore, a path-rewarding strategy is employed to manage the paths taken by the bees across multiple iterations. Finally, by integrating the C51-Atom algorithm, the focus shifts from individual fitness values to distributions of values, and the Bellman operator is used to update recursive distributions, thereby exploiting higher rewards more effectively. The proposed method is evaluated on 39 well-known benchmark functions, demonstrating that PRT-ABC and C51-PRT-ABC outperform the original ABC algorithm in 34 cases. Comparisons with other ABC variants further indicate that our approach effectively manages and directs bee trajectories, reducing excessive random exploration and yielding superior solutions for complex optimization problems.</p>
